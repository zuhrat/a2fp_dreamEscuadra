After having a discussion with Mr.Brown, the team went off to fix their proposal.
Zuhra and Aleks decided the rough structure of the potential calendar.

Zuhra:
  Wrote the NODE (named "Day") class
  Wrote half the LINKED LIST (named "Calendar") class
  Wrote the setup page but there is a glitch
  She uploaded the code and is waiting for her team to look over it and hopefully figure out how to fix it.
